### in this, we are creating ec2 instance in ap-south-1 with naming convention "Example-1". this is basic terraform file to understand how ec2 is created using terraform.

### 1. Terraform init: When you run terraform init, Terraform reads the configuration files in the current directory (usually main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) and installs the necessary plugins and modules required to interact with the providers specified in the configuration. 
### -> terraform init also initializes the backend configuration, if specified, which determines where the state file will be stored. The state file keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. (IN terraform-backend) we did this one.

### 2. Terraform plan: When you run terraform plan, Terraform compares the current state of your infrastructure (as recorded in the state file) to the desired state described in your configuration files.
### -> The execution plan is purely a preview of changes and does not make any actual modifications to your infrastructure. It provides valuable information about what Terraform will do when you apply the changes.

### 3. Terraform apply: When you run terraform apply, Terraform reads the execution plan generated by terraform plan and executes the necessary actions to reach the desired state.
### -> Once confirmed, Terraform begins making the changes to your infrastructure by creating, updating, or deleting resources as necessary. After applying the changes, Terraform updates the state file to reflect the new state of your infrastructure, which includes any changes that were applied.

### 4. Terraform validate: This is used to validate the terraform syntax.
